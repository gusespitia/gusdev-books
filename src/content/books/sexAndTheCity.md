**Sex and The City: Kiss and Tell is the ultimate fan bible, offering a comprehensive behind the scenes guide to NYC and its most fabulous foursome -- the friends and boyfriends, the bar rooms and bedrooms, the infatuations and fashions. Packed with information and photos not available anywhere else, it will fascinate and delight its readers with wholly original material from the show's stars, producers, writers, costume designers, and more.**

It includes all-access passes to the sets, production offices, and wardrobe closets at the Silvercup studios; an insider's tour of the sets; and a detailed map of the bistros and boutiques where Carrie and friends sip, shop, and seduce. Each of the show's major players are interviewed, offering revealing, intimate biographies and sharing the true life stories that inspire every episode. An elegant, beautiful edition with an exclusive introduction from Sarah Jessica Parker herself, this book is every bit as intoxicating as the pink Cosmopolitans sipped by Carrie and friends at Manhattan's chichest hot spots.
